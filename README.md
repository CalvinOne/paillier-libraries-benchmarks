# Benching Paillier libraries

Benchmarks of libraries implementing Paillier encryption in various languages as part of a [blog post](https://medium.com/snips-ai/benchmarking-paillier-encryption-15631a0b5ad8) on the concrete performance of [our Rust library](https://github.com/snipsco/rust-paillier).

All code has been tested on macOS and Google GCE (Ubuntu), some also on Raspberry Pis and mobile phones.

Each subdirectory contains notes regarding specific installation and running. [Setup instructions for a blank Google GCE instance](README-GCE.md) and [Running Rust+Ramp test on phones](README-Dinghy.md) are also available.
